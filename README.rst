- The "Main Class" acts as the entry point of the application.
- Each "Controller" represents a component responsible for handling incoming requests and interacting with the services.
- Each "Service" represents a component responsible for implementing business logic and performing operations related to the specific functionality.
- Each "Repository" represents a component responsible for interacting with the database and performing CRUD operations.
