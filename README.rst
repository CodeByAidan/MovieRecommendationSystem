 Installation
**************

#. Clone the repository:

.. code:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/username/MovieRecommendationSystem.git

2. Download `Docker Desktop <https://www.docker.com/>`_ and MySQL 8.0
   (use `MySQL Installer <https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/>`_)
   and run the following commands:

   #. Configure the MySQL container in `docker-compose-mysql.yml
      </docker-compose-mysql.yml>`_ (change out the
      ``MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD`` value to whatever password you want to use
      when logging in to MySQL Command Line Client/MySQL Workbench):

      .. code:: yaml

         version: '3.8'

         services:
           localmysql:
             container_name: db
             restart: always
             image: 'mysql'
             environment:
               MYSQL_DATABASE: 'movie_recommendation'
               MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: yourpassword # Change this to your own password

             ports:
               - 3308:3306
         #    volumes:
         #      - 'db:/var/lib/mysql'
         ##      - './db/init.sql:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/init.sql'
         #volumes:
         #  mysqldata:

   #. Open a terminal, and the Docker Desktop application, and run the
      following command to start a MySQL container:

      .. code:: bash

         cd /path/to/MovieRecommendationSystem
         docker-compose -f docker-compose-mysql.yml up -d

   #. Update the database configuration in
      ``src/main/resources/application-default.properties``:

      .. code:: properties

         spring:
           task:
             execution:
               pool:
                 core-size: 10
                 max-size: 20
                 queue-capacity: 50
           datasource:
             url: jdbc:mysql://127.0.0.1:3308/movie_recommendation
             username: root # Change this to your own username
             password: yourpassword # Change this to your own password
           jpa:
             hibernate:
               ddl-auto: update
         #  lifecycle:
         #    timeout-per-shutdown-phase: 20s
         #
         #logging:
         #  level:
         #    com.movie.recommendation: debug


         server:
           port: 8080
           shutdown: graceful

4. Install maven dependencies:

   .. code:: bash

      cd MovieRecommendationSystem
      mvn install

#. Download MovieLens Dataset and Extract Data:

   #. Make sure you have Git Bash installed on your system. If you are
      using Windows, open Git Bash for the following steps.

   #. Open your terminal or Git Bash and navigate to the root directory
      of your ``MovieRecommendationSystem`` project.

   #. Copy and paste the following one-liner command into your terminal
      or Git Bash:

      .. code:: bash

         if [ ! -d "src/main/resources/data/ml-25m" ]; then curl -O https://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-25m.zip && unzip ml-25m.zip -d src/main/resources/data/ && rm ml-25m.zip; fi

   (Note: If you're on Windows and don't have Git Bash, you can download
   it from the official website: https://git-scm.com/downloads )

   4. Press Enter to execute the command. The script will download the
      zip file containing the MovieLens dataset and extract its contents
      to ``src/main/resources/data/ml-25m/``.

   #. After the command completes, the zip file will be removed, and you
      should see the MovieLens dataset files in the
      ``src/main/resources/data/ml-25m/`` directory of your project.

#. Build and run the application using Maven:

   .. code:: bash

      cd MovieRecommendationSystem
      mvn spring-boot:run

#. Create an HTTPS request to any of the endpoints, for example, to load
   in the data from the MovieLens dataset, you can create a POST
   http://localhost:8080/loadDefaultMovies request using Postman, or
   commands like:

   .. code:: bash

      curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/loadDefaultMovies

   Or on Windows:

   .. code:: powershell

      Invoke-WebRequest -Method POST -Uri http://localhost:8080/loadDefaultMovies"
